# Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
- Yes, I had encountered several issues while working on this project. Although it was somewhat challenging for me, I loved working on it. 
- I had started this project using Spring Boot framework and Java for the backend. I was successfully able to make the API calls using Java. However, as I went further in the process and tried connecting the backend with the frontend React, I was encountering errors. I spent some time solving it but since I thought I was hitting a roadblock everytime I try to find the reason for the error, I decided to try a different approach and started from scratch.
- I was able to use axios alone to make the API calls and thus thought I wouldn't need a "special" backend for this project

# Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
- No, actually I feel it is under-designed. I'm pretty sure I could have done much much better if I didn't have a lot on my plate during this week. 

# If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
- Firstly I think I would have to change the way the API call is made because there certain limitations for the free usage of API
- Secondly, I guess instead of making an API call for every user, we can try making it just once and serving it to all users

# What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
- Like I said earlier, I would have definitely improved the design and UI of the application
- Also, I would have tried fixing the error that I encountered using Spring Boot and proceeded with it
- Then I would have given the user an option to enter the crypto exchange of their choice by providing the API key of the exchange
